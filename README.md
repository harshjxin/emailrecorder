You'll need to create a MySQL database with a table named bookings that has a column named email to store the collected email addresses.

This example gives you a starting point, but remember to secure your PHP code by implementing input validation and protection against SQL injection. Additionally, use secure practices for database connections and consider using prepared statements for database queries.

For customization- You can either do it yourself or please feel free to contact me on my email- harshitjxin@altmails.com
If it is some basic work that wouldnt take me too long, I will do it for free.
