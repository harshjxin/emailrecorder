# Introduction
This is useful get users to signup to a newsletter, or any other purpose you might want to use it for. It stores the recorded e-mails in a database which you can look through later.

# Steps to set it up
You'll need to create a MySQL database with a table named bookings that has a column named email to store the collected email addresses.

This example gives you a starting point, but remember to secure your PHP code by implementing input validation and protection against SQL injection. Additionally, use secure practices for database connections and consider using prepared statements for database queries (You can skip this if you think there is no reason for a hacker to attack it.)
